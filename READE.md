# Boilerplates
My personal library of boilerplates for very basic projects or a simple beginning!
These boilerplates are mainly used for explaining the key functional of the dedicated boilerplates. So if i need them in the future i can look it up here and read the docs for more understanding.

You can find projects with the languages/frameworks:
*   Vue
*   React
*   Node
*   Flutter
*   Python
